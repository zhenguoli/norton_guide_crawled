        ; File attributes
        attr_normal    = 00h    ; File can be read from or written to
        attr_readonly  = 01h    ; File can be read from, not written to
        attr_hidden    = 02h    ; File or directory is hidden
        attr_system    = 04h    ; System file or directory
        attr_volume    = 08h    ; Filename is the volume label
        attr_directory = 10h    ; Filename identifies a directory
        attr_archive   = 20h    ; File modified since last backup
        ATTR_ANY       = 3fh    ; All of the above (OR'ed together)

        ; bits  7654 3210
        ;       ..ad vshr       Bits 7 and 6 are reserved (set to 0).
        ;
        ; attr_readonly Write attempts to the file will cause an error.
        ; attr_hidden   System commands (such as DIR) do not list the
        ;               file. Functions such as FindFirst/FindNext do
        ;               not return information about the file, unless
        ;               this attribute is specified.
        ; attr_system   Reserved (by convention) for system files such
        ;               as IBMBIO.COM or IO.SYS. This has the same
        ;               effect as attr_hidden and, when applied to
        ;               program files, prevents COMMAND.COM from
        ;               finding and running the files.
        ; attr_archive  DOS automatically sets this attribute when the
        ;               file is created or written to. The attribute
        ;               does not affect access to the file but gives
        ;               (backup) programs a quick way to check for
        ;               potential changes to the file contents.
